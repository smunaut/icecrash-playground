This repository contains a variety of cores and examples and they are
licensed under a wide variety of licenses :

 - MIT license
 - CERN OpenHardware License (one of the 3 variants)
 - Possibly others for code imported from other projects

 Full license text for those is available in the doc/ directory.

Each file/project/core has the applicable license in its header.

This repository also contains submodules that are licensed under their
own licenses.

In general I target the CERN-OHL for the HDL and MIT for the software.
It's however possible some have not been migrated yet or are imported
from external sources. If you want some of the code here under a different
license, feel free to ask and I'll see what I can do.
